# Online Quiz Application

The Online Quiz Application is a Java-based quiz management system designed to offer a user-friendly, interactive platform for taking quizzes online. It automates quiz management, grading, and provides real-time score tracking.

Developed an interactive Quiz Application using Java, Swing Framework, and JDBC, with Microsoft Excel integration for dynamic question management.
The application allows users to attempt quizzes with various customizable options. It supports Excel data import for question management via Java I/O, enabling administrators to easily update and manage the question pool without modifying the codebase.

Key features implemented:

Excel Integration:Import quiz questions directly from Excel sheets using Java I/O for flexible question management.

Random Question Selection: Each quiz fetches a randomized set of questions from the imported data.

Time Limits: A countdown timer restricts the quiz duration to simulate real-time test conditions and enhance user engagement.

50-50 Lifeline: A lifeline feature eliminates two incorrect options, providing a better chance for users to answer difficult questions.

Automated Scoring: The application is designed to automatically calculate and display the final score upon quiz completion.

Structured Data Handling: Used 2D arrays for efficient storage and manipulation of questions, options, and correct answers.

2. Open in NetBeans or Eclipse.
3. Configure the database connection if needed.
